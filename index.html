    <p>Total spending: 100 to 200 yuan per person</p>

    <h3>Date</h3> 
    <p>It's not set yet. The weather data overwhelmingly suggests that we'll have crystal clear days early next week. Sunday's wind will likely blow all the pollution away. So next Monday to Wedsnesday will be OK.</p>

    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>Depart from Dongzhimen: 9:30 am</p>
    <p>Back to Dongzhimen: 2 pm next day</p>

    <h3>Transport</h3> 
    <p>Dongzhimen Transport Hub to Huairou: Bus 916, ¥4.8(with transit card), or ¥13</p>
    <p>Huairou to Xi Zha Zi village option 1: Bus 862 to Yujiayuan Station, Bus H25 to Xi Zha Zi, black taxi, ¥4 with card, or ¥10</p>
    <p>Huairou to Xi Zha Zi village option 2: taxi, ¥150 in total</p>

    <p>Huairou to Dongzhimen: Bus 916, ¥4.8(with transit card), or ¥13</p>

    <h3>Accomodation</h3>
    <p>Option 1: Villagers will carry camping supplies to our camping site before sunset.</p>
    <p>Option 2: We go down the Great Wall, spend a night in a guesthouse, and hike to Mutianyu next morning. Price ranges from 30 to 100 per night. See the Lonely Planet "sleeping and eating" section.</p>
    <p>Option 1 is preferred; however, it depends on availability of equipment and arrangement with villagers and it's vulnarable to weather conditions.</p>

	<h3>Jiankou Great Wall</h3>
	<p>Lonely Planet China described this section as "stupefyingly gorgeous", "incomparable" and "sublime", with "tantalizing panoramic views of the Great Wall". <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Jiankou">See Jiankou's photos here. You'll understand why.</a></p>
    
    <h3>Mutianyu Great Wall</h3>
    <p>The steepest of Badaling, Juyongguan, and other restored sections</p>
    <p>Best reviewed Beijing attraction on <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/%E6%85%95%E7%94%B0%E5%B3%AA%E9%95%BF%E5%9F%8E-great-wall-at-mutianyu/4b98a9bdf964a520974a35e3">Foursquare.com</a></p>

    <h3>Safety</h3>
    <p>We shall stay away from the dangerous areas and never hike in the dark. The trip shall be canceled in case of a sand storm or rain. Breath-taking views have tempted many people to go totally nuts, climbing the 80 degree cliff without any preparation or straying away from the well-established route without local guides. My bleakest estimation based on Google's news results shows one rescue mission per month and four deaths per year. A research paper by an NGO says there were 6 accidents and one death in 2010.</p>
    <p>Nobody shall be allowed to go nuts during the hike. As we see fit, local guides may be a great option for some safe but unexplored area, at an acceptable rate of 50 yuan for 4 hours.</p>
    <p>Nobody in our group shall be held responsible for any other person's safety issues and accidents.</p>

    <p><b>Hike from Jiankou to Mutianyu</b> This hike starts in Xi Zha Zi village (village fee: ¥20 as of Feb 2014), at the foot of Jiankou Great Wall section. After buying the tickets take the first road left (Yi Dui - there should be staff around, who can confirm, that this is Yi Dui). Follow the road for a bit, until you see a blue sign to your left, saying this part of the Great Wall is closed. Take the path on the right of it (follow the red arrow! Do not take the left path, even though it is "a narrow dirt path" as mentioned in the Lonely Planet guide-book.) There will be more red arrows and dots along the way, eventually leading you to the Great Wall (Feb. 2014). You walk about a hour in medium-rough terrain where you will encounter some local villagers' ladders which you will have to use in order to climb the wall (¥5, none of those in Feb. 2014). After arriving at the Great Wall, head left (east) towards Mutianyu, a hike that will take you about 2-3 hours. The first 1,5 hours is on the unrestored area of the wall, the rest on the restored area. Add 0,5-1 hour if you choose to walk the Ox Horn, which is a more rough part of the wall (you can also skip it by following the signs). The hike can be done in sneakers, but hiking shoes would be a much better choice. Don't try to do the hike when it's wet, because it has some very (!) steep and slippery parts. While it would be totally possible to do the hike the other way round (from Mutianyu to Jiankou), finding transportation (probably back to Huairou) would be much harder to find.</p>

    <h3>Lonely Planet China Travel Guide, published in May 2013</h3>
    <p>Jiankou For stupefyingly gorgeous hikes along perhaps Beijing’s most incomparable section of ‘wild wall’, head to the rear section of the Jiankou Great Wall ( Hou Jiankou Changcheng; admission ¥20) , accessible from the town of Huairou. Tantalising panoramic views of the Great Wall spread out in either direction from here, as the crumbling brickwork meanders dramatically along a mountain ridge; the setting is truly sublime. But this is completely unrestored wall, so it is both dangerous and, strictly speaking, illegal to hike along it. Make sure you wear footwear with very good grips, and never attempt to traverse this section in the rain, particularly during thunderstorms. When the weather is fine, though, the Jiankou area offers fabulous opportunities to hike and camp along the wall. From the drop off at Xizhazi Village (;Xizhazi Cun), it’s a one-hour walk uphill to the wall, along a narrow dirt path, which climbs through a beautiful pine forest. From here turn east (left) to hike all the way to Mutianyu (two hours), from where you can easily pick up transport back to Huairou, or even to Beijing. Note, there are different parts, or dui () to Xizhazi Village. All have paths that lead up to the wall, but for the sake of ease, head to the first part of the village (; yi dui), which is down a lane to your left immediately after the ticket office.</p>
