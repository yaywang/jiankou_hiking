    <h1>Important Info for Everyone Going with the Group</h1>
    <h3>Safety</h3>
    <p>The author, I, have not been there, though there has been phone calls and chats with locals and extensive research.</p> 
    <p>We shall stay away from the dangerous areas and never hike in the dark. The trip shall be canceled in case of a sand storm or rain. Breath-taking views have tempted many people to go totally nuts, climbing the 80 degree cliff without any preparation or straying away from the well-established route without local guides. My bleakest estimation based on Google's news results shows one rescue mission per month and four deaths per year. A research paper by an NGO says there were 6 accidents and one death in 2010.</p>
    <p>Nobody shall be allowed to go nuts during the hike. As we see fit, local guides may be a great option for some safe but unexplored area, at an acceptable rate of 200 yuan for 3 hours. If one of us feel challenged on Day 1, we'll have a guide accompany us to Mutianyu, for ¥300 in total.</p>
    <p>Nobody in our group shall be held responsible for any other person's safety issues and accidents, except that we'll split the guide fee if one of us feels challenged and we'll adjust schedule because of one member's safety concerns.</p>
    <h3>Route</h3>
    <p>The route overview can be seen below. We'll rely on local guesthouse owners for the specifics of the tracks and campsite location, and safety issues related with each of them.</p>

    <h3>Saturday Lunch at Zhaoshi Shan Zhuang, or Zhao's Villa</h3>
    <p>This villa has been the most famous among professional photographers. Mr. Zhao, the owner of the villa, will advise on campsite and more interesting routes to explore after the lunch. We'll go to another guesthouse in case he's totally booked; see "Plan B" section at the bottom. And we may prefer to stay with the villager who does our delivery.</p>

    <h3>Route Overview</h3>
    <img src="jiankou_area_map.png">
    <h4>Return Track</h4>
    <p>Locate Sharp North Tower in this map. It's located at the east edge of Jiankou section. On Day 2, we'll head east and follow the wall to the gate of Mutianyu, taking the shortcut of ox horn, for 2.5 hours; and that's for sure. I found absolutely no accident associated with this track; and this is the one-day track recommended by WikiTravel and Lonely Planet.</p>

    <h4>Exploration Track</h4>
    <p>Note that a square represents a tower. Six towers to the east of Sharp North Tower is Jiankou, namesake for the whole section. The track is well established yet risky.</p>

    <p>You could easily find the biggest red square, Beijing Knot. Beijing Knot（Beijing Jie， 北京节）splits the entire Great Wall into three parts. The Wall originates from Shanhai Pass (Shanhai Guan, 山海关), near the sea. From the sea to Beijing Knot, there's only one wall; however, from Beijing Knot to the west, there're actually two, the inner Great Wall ending in Shanxi, the outer Wall, ie, the Wall, ending in Gansu.</p>   
    <p><b>To my knowledge, all Jiankou accidents in recent news happen on the walls leading to this point.</b>The wall from Beijing Knot to the first tower in the north has almost collapsed; the most notorious and deadly 80 degree cliff also stood nearby. There're easier and safe tracks for detour or straight from the village up to certain towers.</p>

    <p>As said, the detailed route shall be decided after we've arrived; the locals will know the tracks best.</p> 

    <h3>Time</h3>
    <h4>The Sun</h4>
    <p>Sunset Saturday: 7:02</p>
    <p>Sunrise Sunday: 5:02</p>
